PCP's ability to graph system metrics in real time at high resolution remotely from multiple machines is unmatched. PCP provides me with a deep understanding of how the system performs without interfering in the behaviour I'm trying to observe and so allows me to quickly identify differences in system behaviour, balance and variability in a way that no other tool does. PCP is a tool every engineer should have in their toolkit.\""

We log all this information to a central repository and use it to analyze performance and alert us to faults. The PCP software is easily extensible to add specialized data collection for our needs. The PCP team is always responsive to any help requests and willing to assist with development and additions to the software. PCP has decreased the amount of effort we need to expend for site monitoring while providing more metrics on the status of our systems.\""

msgid "\"At Netflix, PCP is mainly used for collecting high resolution performance metrics to perform cross-metric correlation and to detect anomalies. PCP stateless model makes it lightweight and robust. Clients are responsible for keeping track of state, sampling rate and computation. We built a web client that fetches performance metrics published by PCP running on cloud instances. It offers self service to Netflix teams to capture on-demand performance metrics from a cloud instance. PCP offers a rich set of performance monitoring agents (PMDA) and libraries to build custom PMDAs. With the integration of Brendan Gregg's <a href=\"http://www.brendangregg.com/FlameGraphs/cpuflamegraphs.html\">FlameGraph</a> and <a href=\"http://www.brendangregg.com/HeatMaps/latency.html\">Heat Maps</a> into PCP, capturing and analyzing low level profiling data is simply a matter of a mouse click in Vector. We greatly appreciate all the support provided by PCP community. We have plans to contribute to PCP and open source Vector and custom PCP PMDA once tested and ready.\""

PCP is a perfect fit to replace the outgoing sysstat legacy tools, especially now that PCP is fully supported in RHEL 6.6, RHEL 7 and onward. Compelling features such as broad and easily extensible metrics coverage, fully distributed operation, uniform metric naming and meta-data, APIs with multiple language bindings, robust configurable logging services, and secure authenticated IPC protocols are essential in the modern enterprise environment. In our business of providing critical support services, the ability to capture archive logs on customer systems for off-site retrospective analysis is an especially important feature where PCP excels.\""
